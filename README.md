# FSCE: fun and simple coding examples..

This is a simple repo to demonstrate some fundamental concepts.

In our scenario, there is a) an Arduino-based project with workshop code from school, and b) Darwin/Linux-based workstations to use for other purposes.

The idea is to share code between both an Arduino firmware, and a simple C-based binary build product.

We will demonstrate how to write C code that will produce:

- Arduino project code suitable to use in school workshops
- Simulator code, suitable to use in learning C

Two areas of the project will function in parallel, the Arduino school project code, and the 'test/hack/experiment' playground in the C-based binary environment.

This will provide cross-platform build scaffolding methods and other tooling for us to construct other things.

## Projects:

1: trafficlight - A traffic-light simulator project intended to introduce the idea of a basic state machine as it might work in a traffic control system.
